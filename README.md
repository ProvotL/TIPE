# TIPE
Computer science TIPE which explore the game of sprouts.

TIPE is a project that all french students in Preparatory Classes have to do.
Mine was on the game of sprouts.

This code might be realy hard to understand, in that case, you should check these papers :

This was my first big projet, so my variables don't respect camel case or any other case and is not professional at all, but i'm still very proud of it.
It is also inspired by glop for 10-20% of the code, because it was realy hard to be sure I checked all cases.

Be carefull to change the direction of the files in the code for it to work.

You can also try these calls if you don't want to modify anything :

old_programme_principal(3,True,True,'normal')            \n
old_programme_principal(4,True,True,'normal')            \n
old_programme_principal(5,True,True,'normal')            \n

Don't try anything above n=10, it will take probably month or even years to finish.

All of my results respect the sprouts conjecture.
